## Human-vs-Computer
Welcome to the 0/1 guessing game!                                  
                                                                   
Enter 0 or 1, trying to outsmart the computer, which is going to   
attempt to forecast your guesses.  On each move the score indicator
moves to the left if the computer guesses correctly, and moves    
to the right if the computer does not.                              
    Enter 't' to toggle displaying the data table.                 
    Enter 'r' to reset the board.                                  
    Enter 'x' to exit.                                             
Good luck, you'll need it!
